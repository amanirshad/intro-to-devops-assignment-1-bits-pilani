Assignment Overview: Implementing Automated CI/CD Pipelines for ACEest Fitness & Gym
Objective - This assignment is designed to provide students with comprehensive, hands-on experience in modern DevOps methodologies. By executing this project, students will attain professional proficiency in Version Control (Git/GitHub), Containerization (Docker), and the orchestration of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines using GitHub Actions and Jenkins.
Problem Statement- You have been appointed as a Junior DevOps Engineer for ACEest Fitness & Gym, a rapidly scaling startup. Your mission is to architect and implement a robust, automated deployment workflow that guarantees code integrity, environmental consistency, and rapid delivery.
Your solution must transition the application through a rigorous lifecycle—from local development to an automated Jenkins BUILD environment.
Core Assignment Phases
1.	Application Development & Modularization Develop a foundational Flask web application tailored for fitness and gym management. You will be provided with a baseline Python script to initialize the core logic and service endpoints.
2.	Version Control System (VCS) Strategy Initialize a local Git repository and synchronize it with a remote GitHub counterpart. You are expected to follow industry standards for versioning, including descriptive commit messages and branch management to track features, bug fixes, and infrastructure updates.
3.	Unit Testing & Validation Framework Integrate the Pytest framework to develop a comprehensive suite of unit tests. These tests must validate the internal logic of the Flask application, ensuring that all components perform according to specification before they reach the build stage.
4.	Containerization with Docker Encapsulate the Flask application, along with its environment and dependencies, into a portable Docker Image. This ensures "write once, run anywhere" consistency, eliminating the "it works on my machine" syndrome during the transition from testing to production.
5.	The Jenkins BUILD & Quality Gate Integrate a Jenkins server to handle the primary BUILD phase. You must configure a Jenkins project that pulls the latest code from GitHub and performs a clean build of the environment. This serves as a secondary validation layer to ensure the code compiles and integrates correctly in a controlled build environment.
6.	Automated CI/CD Pipeline via GitHub Actions Design a fully automated pipeline using GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/main.yml). The pipeline must be triggered by every push or pull_request, executing the following critical stages:
•	Build & Lint: Compile the application and check for syntax errors.
•	Docker Image Assembly: Successfully build the Docker container.
•	Automated Testing: Execute the Pytest suite inside the containerized environment to confirm stability.
Required Deliverables
Students must submit a link to a publicly accessible GitHub Repository containing:
•	Source Code: All Flask application files (app.py, requirements.txt).
•	Test Suite: All Pytest script files.
•	Infrastructure as Code: A functional Dockerfile and the GitHub Actions YAML configuration.
•	Documentation: A professional README.md detailing:
•	Local setup and execution instructions.
•	Steps to run tests manually.
•	A high-level overview of the Jenkins and GitHub Actions integration logic.
Evaluation Criteria
Submissions will be assessed based on the following professional benchmarks:
•	Application Integrity: Does the Flask application function as specified.
•	VCS Maturity: Are Git commits meaningful and logically structured.
•	Testing Coverage: Do the Pytest cases effectively cover core functionalities.
•	Docker Efficiency: Is the Dockerfile optimized for size and security.
•	Pipeline Reliability: * Does the Jenkins BUILD trigger and complete without errors.
•	Does the GitHub Actions workflow successfully pass the Build and Test stages on every push.
•	Documentation Clarity: Is the README.md professional and easy to follow for other engineers.
